## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: How should maintainers supply sandbox options without code edits? → A: TOML file at `config/sandbox.toml` with documented keys.
- Q: Which horizontal play-area shape and size should the sandbox enforce? → A: Circular boundary with 30 m radius centered at origin.
- Q: Which key toggles the in-sandbox control overlay? → A: `H` key toggles control instructions.
- Q: Where should sandbox start/stop/config override logs be emitted? → A: Emit structured JSON via `structlog` to stdout.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

**Constitution Alignment:** For every story, explain how it preserves host autonomy (feature flags + community vote workflow), safeguards class identity while allowing flexibility, keeps knowledge discoverable in-game, and respects fairness, safety, and monetization guardrails.

### User Story 1 - Launch the sandbox and explore (Priority: P1)

As a maintainer, I want to launch a default 3D sandbox so I can verify the engine boots, view basic shapes, and freely walk the camera around.

**Why this priority**: Establishes the minimal interactive prototype that proves the engine integration works and lets stakeholders experience camera navigation first-hand.

**Independent Test**: Start the application from a clean checkout, reach the sandbox scene within 5 seconds, and traverse to each placed shape without errors.

**Constitution Alignment:** Maintainers can enable or disable the sandbox via configuration (host autonomy), the free-fly camera is neutral to class abilities and keeps other archetypes unaffected (class identity), in-app control hints keep knowledge discoverable in the experience (discoverability), and no monetization or competitive impacts exist (fairness and safety).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean repository clone, **When** the maintainer runs the sandbox entry point, **Then** a window opens showing a ground plane plus at least three shapes positioned visibly.
2. **Given** the sandbox is running, **When** the maintainer uses keyboard and mouse controls, **Then** the camera moves and rotates smoothly without clipping through geometry or exceeding the defined play zone.

### User Story 2 - Understand controls and boundaries (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want on-screen or easily accessible guidance so I know which keys move, look, and adjust speed while staying within the intended walk area.

**Why this priority**: Control clarity reduces onboarding friction for collaborators and keeps demos aligned with intended pacing.

**Independent Test**: Launch the sandbox, follow the displayed guidance, and verify the camera remains above the ground plane and within horizontal bounds during movement.

**Constitution Alignment:** Control guidance can be toggled per host preference (autonomy), messaging is generic so it does not privilege any class or playstyle (class identity), instructions appear in-world to avoid external documentation (discoverability), and guidance avoids competitive advantages or monetized elements (fairness and safety).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the sandbox is running, **When** the maintainer presses the `H` key, **Then** concise control instructions appear and disappear without obstructing exploration.
2. **Given** the maintainer moves toward the sandbox perimeter, **When** they reach the 30 m radius circular boundary, **Then** the camera stops or gently redirects without breaking immersion.

---

### User Story 3 - Configure the sandbox for demos (Priority: P3)

As a host maintainer, I want to adjust sandbox options (e.g., camera sensitivity, shape layout) without editing engine source so I can tailor internal demos safely.

**Why this priority**: Configurability lets different teams showcase the sandbox while respecting production guardrails.

**Independent Test**: Modify the provided configuration file, restart the sandbox, and confirm the new layout and control tuning apply without code changes.

**Constitution Alignment:** Config updates flow through a clearly documented toggle that host admins control (autonomy), options avoid disabling class-defining elements by focusing on neutral parameters (class identity), documentation for adjustments lives within the repo and in-app cues (discoverability), and safeguards prevent settings that could break fairness (e.g., disabling boundaries) from shipping by default (fairness and safety).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the `config/sandbox.toml` file with sandbox parameters, **When** the maintainer changes camera sensitivity and relaunches, **Then** the new sensitivity is applied and reflected in control hints.
2. **Given** the `config/sandbox.toml` file specifies shape positions, **When** the sandbox loads, **Then** shapes spawn at the configured coordinates while remaining within the defined bounds.

### Edge Cases

- Launch attempt on hardware lacking proper graphics drivers.
- Sandbox window loses focus or is minimized while movement keys remain pressed.
- Camera collides with geometry edges or attempts to leave the 30 m radius permitted area vertically or horizontally.
- Configuration values push shapes outside bounds or overlap them causing z-fighting.
- Input device not present (no mouse) or alternate keyboard layouts remap expected keys.
- Structured JSON logging pipeline misconfigured, causing stdout capture to fail or drop events.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Provide a launchable sandbox entry point that opens a 3D scene with a visible ground plane and at least three distinct primitive shapes.
- **FR-002**: Implement first-person camera controls using keyboard (move, sprint toggle) and mouse (look) that respond within 150 ms and cap vertical rotation to prevent disorientation.
- **FR-003**: Prevent the camera from passing through floor geometry or exceeding a circular horizontal boundary with a 30 m radius centered at the origin to maintain a safe exploration space.
- **FR-004**: Display in-experience control instructions that the maintainer can toggle with the `H` key, covering movement, look, sprint, and help toggles without blocking the scene.
- **FR-005**: Deliver a configuration surface at `config/sandbox.toml` that lets maintainers adjust camera sensitivity, movement speed, and primitive layout without code edits, with documented keys for each option.
- **FR-006**: Include a simple enable/disable toggle so hosts can opt in to the sandbox without affecting production builds or downstream consumers.
- **FR-007**: Provide lightweight logging of sandbox start/stop events and configuration overrides as structured JSON via `structlog` to stdout to support internal telemetry needs without personal data collection.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Sandbox Scene**: Defines the ground plane, sky/background treatment, and collection of primitive shapes with positions, rotations, and materials for the demo environment.
- **Camera Controller**: Captures user input state (movement vector, look delta, sprint flag), enforces speed limits and the 30 m radius horizontal boundary, and manages camera height relative to the ground plane.
- **Sandbox Configuration**: Host-editable settings stored in `config/sandbox.toml` that determine camera tuning, shape catalog, layout coordinates, and feature enablement status.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: From a clean checkout, the sandbox window loads to a controllable state within 5 seconds on reference hardware (mid-tier laptop with integrated graphics).
- **SC-002**: Internal testers can reach every placed shape and return to origin within 3 minutes without leaving the permitted bounds or experiencing control confusion (verified via observation checklist).
- **SC-003**: At least 90% of internal survey respondents report that the control instructions were sufficient to navigate without external documentation.
- **SC-004**: Sandbox sessions emit structured JSON via `structlog` for start/stop events and configuration overrides with zero personally identifiable information and no more than 1% error rate across 20 consecutive launches.

## Assumptions

- Panda3D is the selected rendering engine per stakeholder direction; this specification treats engine choice as fixed.
- Target users interact via keyboard and mouse on desktop-class operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) with standard layouts.
- Reference hardware baseline is a 2022 mid-tier laptop (integrated graphics, 8 GB RAM); performance expectations scale accordingly.
- The sandbox is intended for internal demos and onboarding, not for external release, so localization and accessibility are scoped to internal needs initially.

## Dependencies

- Availability of Panda3D runtime and compatible drivers on developer machines.
- Existing project build tooling can package or run the sandbox without conflicting with production entry points.
- Internal telemetry collectors can ingest the sandbox start/stop logs if needed for dashboards.
