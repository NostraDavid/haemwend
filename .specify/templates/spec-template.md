# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

**Constitution Alignment:** For every story, explain how it preserves host autonomy (feature flags + community vote workflow), safeguards class identity while allowing flexibility, keeps knowledge discoverable in-game, and respects fairness, safety, and monetization guardrails.

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when a host community vetoes or delays the feature flag vote?
- How does the system respond if a class loses access to its signature mechanic during the flow?
- How do players recover if knowledge about this feature leaks outside the game (e.g., spoilers, data mining)?
- What telemetry or guardrails trigger a rollback when economy fairness or safety limits are breached?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Feature MUST be guard-railed behind a host-specific feature flag with an associated community vote workflow.
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve each class’s signature mechanic/UX while enabling multi-class access to the feature.
- **FR-003**: Players MUST discover and complete the feature entirely in-game without relying on external knowledge sources.
- **FR-004**: Telemetry MUST capture engagement, fairness, and economy impact for host-level dashboards.
- **FR-005**: Monetization and rewards MUST comply with the constitution’s fairness bans (no power selling, clear odds, refund eligibility).

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-006**: Feature MUST surface lore context via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: in-game journals, NPC dialogue, or environmental storytelling?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST throttle host votes within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum concurrent ballots] to respect player impact limits.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: At least [X]% of targeted hosts enable the feature post-vote within [Y] days without triggering a fairness/safety rollback.
- **SC-002**: Players complete the feature’s primary loop within [time] while preserving class identity metrics (no more than [Δ%] variance in signature mechanic usage).
- **SC-003**: In-game discovery surveys show ≥[X]% of players learned about the feature through in-world channels (journals, NPCs, or other players).
- **SC-004**: Economy telemetry stays within guardrail bands (e.g., price inflation <[threshold]%, refund rate <[threshold]% with root-cause notes).
